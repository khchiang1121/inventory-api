# [MODEL CHECKLIST v3]
# Overall structure
# [x] Check all fields in the model are necessary and correct
# [x] Include docstring for the model (describe its purpose)
# Fields
# [x] Have a "name" field, with max_length=255; if needed, set unique=True
# [x] Have a "description" field, and allow blank=True
# [x] Every field should include a help_text (except relationship)
# [x] Set default value if appropriate
# [x] String fields (CharField, TextField) should NOT use null=True
# [x] Use max_length=255 for regular strings; 64 for short text, 32 for very short text
# [x] If linking to users, include both "user" and "user_group" fields
# [x] ForeignKey should always define on_delete explicitly (e.g., CASCADE, SET_NULL)
# [x] ForeignKey that can be optional must use null=True, blank=True
# [x] ManyToManyField should always define a related_name
# [x] ForeignKey should always be named as the model name (e.g., ansible_inventory)
# Meta and representation
# [x] Define __str__() to return a meaningful field (e.g., name)
# [x] Define Meta: ordering, verbose_name, verbose_name_plural, constraints
# [x] Define clean and save if needed
